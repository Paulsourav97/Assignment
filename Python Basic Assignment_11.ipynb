    "logging.disable()\n",

    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is a means for tracking events that happens when a software works.\n",
    "In case the program fails it is difficult to debug a code that has print statements.\n",
    "Print statements will always fail for complex kind of codes.\n",

    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Into will cause the debugger to go into the next function call and break there. \n",
    "Step Over will tell the debugger to execute the next function and break afterwards. \n",
    "Step Out will tell the debugger to finish the current function and break after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have set any break point.\n",
    "Or else it will stop after the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "A break point tells the python interpreter to pause execution at a\n",
    "particular point in the application.\n",
